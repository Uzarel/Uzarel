I'm a former mathematician turned into a data scientist who loves programming!

I'm a PhD candidate in the National PhD in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Naples Federico II. I'm currently working on several industrial projects, European projects as well as personal projects, involving AI-powered IoT solutions, chatbots and more.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Python</strong>: Every day I read and write in Python. I adore the language and the things the community has created using it.</li>
  <li><strong>PyTorch</strong>: I really enjoy using PyTorch for its easy of use to deliver my Deep Learning solutions.</li>
  <li><strong>SQL</strong>: You can't be a fancy data scientist without being able to query data.</li>
</ul>

## Hobbies 🤹🏼‍♂️

<ul>
  <li>🤝 <strong>Volunteering</strong>: I frequently lend a hand to friends and coworkers. I enjoy helping others and being useful. I'm actively looking for groups where I can make a difference.</li>
  <li>🎲 <strong>Games</strong>: I usually play tabletop games with friends, including role-playing games. I also like playing old-fashioned videogames.</li>
  <li>🎼 <strong>Music</strong>: I have been playing classical guitar for more than 10 years, and I'm currently part of a small band.
