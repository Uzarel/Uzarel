I'm a former mathematician turned into a data scientist who loves programming!

I'm a PhD candidate in the National PhD in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Naples Federico II. I'm currently working on several industrial projects, European projects as well as personal projects, involving AI-powered IoT solutions, chatbots and more.
