I'm a former mathematician turned into a data scientist who loves programming!

I'm a research fellow in Computer Vision at URBAN/ECO, a spin-off of University of Naples Federico II. I'm currently working on several industrial projects as well as personal projects.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Python</strong>: Every day I read and write in Python. I adore the language and the things the community has created using it.</li>
  <li><strong>TensorFlow</strong>: I really enjoy using TensorFlow for its easy of use to deliver my solutions.</li>
  <li><strong>SQL</strong>: You can't be a fancy data scientist without being able to query data.</li>
</ul>

## Hobbies 🤹🏼‍♂️

<ul>
  <li>🤝 <strong>Volunteering</strong>: I frequently lend a hand to friends and coworkers. I enjoy helping others and being useful. I'm actively looking for groups where I can make a difference.</li>
  <li>🎲 <strong>Games</strong>: I usually play tabletop games with friends, including role-playing games. I also like playing old-fashioned videogames.</li>
